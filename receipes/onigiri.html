    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Onigiri are Japanese rice balls that are usually wrapped in nori and shaped into a triangle or cylinder. They are
        often eaten as a snack or light meal and can be made with a variety of savory, salty, or sour fillings. The word
        onigiri comes from the Japanese word nigiru, which means "to grasp" or "to squeeze"</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the Rice: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups Japanese short-grain rice (sushi rice or sticky rice)</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups water (for cooking rice)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp rice vinegar (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Filling (Optional):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pickled plum (umeboshi) - 2-3 small plums, pitted (or your preferred filling like tuna, salmon, or seaweed)
        </li>
        <li>1/2 cup cooked salmon flakes (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp mayonnaise (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp soy sauce (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Onigiri Shape: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Shiso leaves (optional for wrapping)</li>
        <li>Roasted seaweed (nori) â€“ cut into strips (optional)</li>
        <li>Sesame seeds (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <h3>1. Prepare the Rice:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Drain the rice for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a rice cooker or pot, combine the rinsed rice and 2 1/2 cups of water. Cook the rice according to your
            rice cooker's instructions or bring it to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover. Simmer for about
            15-20 minutes until the water is absorbed and the rice is tender.</li>
        <li>If using, stir in rice vinegar, sugar, and salt while the rice is still warm, and gently fold it in. Let the
            rice cool down slightly but keep it warm enough to handle.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>2. Prepare the Filling (Optional):</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If you are using umeboshi (pickled plum), remove the pit and mash the plum into a paste. You can also use
            cooked tuna mixed with a little soy sauce and mayonnaise, or flaked cooked salmon.</li>
        <li>Set your filling aside and prepare your toppings (nori strips, sesame seeds, etc.) for the onigiri.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>3. Shape the Onigiri:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wet your hands with water and sprinkle a little salt on your palms to prevent the rice from sticking.</li>
        <li>Take a small amount of rice (about 1/4 to 1/3 cup) and flatten it slightly in your hands.</li>
        <li>Place a small amount of your chosen filling in the center of the rice.</li>
        <li>Carefully mold the rice around the filling into a triangular or oval shape by pressing gently, making sure
            the rice holds together.</li>
        <li>If desired, wrap your onigiri with a piece of nori or a shiso leaf for added flavor and texture.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>4. Serve:</h3>
    <p>Serve your onigiri as a snack or part of a meal, either at room temperature or slightly chilled. Enjoy your
        delicious Japanese rice balls!</p>
